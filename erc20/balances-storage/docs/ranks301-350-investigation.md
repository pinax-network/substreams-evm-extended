# BSC candidates ranked 301–350

This report records the original exploratory survey and getter controls, when
**no new production profiles were promoted** and the fixture had 296 profiles.
The subsequent [qualification](ranks301-350-coverage.md) adds 36 reviewed
profiles after full-window, packaged RPC and holder audits; 14 remain pending.
Selection uses the original immutable RPC ranking for blocks
**122288006–122289029**; it does not rerank a newer interval.

The [investigation evidence](evidence/ranks301-350-investigation.json) records
every candidate, historical runtime, available source binding and survey
outcome. Across 299 sampled Extended blocks, these candidates account for 2,013
reference observations in the full interval. The survey performs **2,106
successful RPC value checks with zero value mismatches**. Forty-seven candidates
have a unique matching mapping hypothesis. None yet has complete mapper parity
or packaged-WASM holder qualification.

Getter inspections complete for 48 candidates. Their tested word controls show
neither a zero-word fallback nor a nonzero-word transformation. These results
are exploratory controls, not proof of complete getter behavior or permission
to ignore other storage writes. Ten historical runtime hashes match previously
reviewed families; token-specific dependencies and full-window checks are still
required.

## Exceptions retained

| Rank | Token | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 319 | 金麟人生 (`0x5b0b5ed3b7d29813ac0c9c4890f5bf1fc4302b0e`) | One empty RPC result at the parent of its deployment block. A fresh recheck confirms empty parent code and nonempty code at block 122288321. It is an unavailable predeployment getter, never a zero or passing value check. |
| 324 | WMAI (`0x1b282603099647e2ec3461b2714acf38009d66b6`) | Slot 1 has eight matching training observations but only one nonzero holder, below the discovery requirement of two. Historical runtime is bound to verified source with a direct inherited balance getter at slot 1; that source alone does not qualify all observed storage writes. |
| 327 | Tracker (`0x76096218ea7e6e1a3c6a549c88e2928c633b5f63`) | Both slots 0 and 12 match six training observations across five nonzero holders. Source is unavailable. Separate follow-up controls identify slot 0 as the observed getter input. |

The [getter follow-up](evidence/ranks301-350-getter-followup.json) resolves these
two sampled mapping gaps without relaxing discovery thresholds. WMAI's getter
reads slot 1, consistent with its verified source. Tracker's getter reads slot 0;
overriding it with 0, 1, 123 and uint256 max returns exactly those values.
Overriding the corresponding slot-12 word with the same four values leaves the
historical balance unchanged. The slot-12 hypothesis is a coincident value,
not evidence of a second balance getter. Each trace reads one word and makes no
external call. These three inspections and twelve controls remain separate from
the original survey totals. Full storage-rule review is still required.

The original survey's `rpc_unresolved` status remains unchanged. The separate
[recheck evidence](evidence/ranks301-350-recheck.json) records the predeployment
classification, original response, canonical parent/current hashes and digests.
No RPC value mismatch was discarded or retried into a passing sample.

The subsequent qualification performs source/runtime review, explicit storage
rules, all 1,024 consecutive blocks and actual packaged-WASM comparisons for
36 candidates. The remaining 14 still need those gates. Cold unknown balances,
unchanged holders and global enumeration remain separately measured.
