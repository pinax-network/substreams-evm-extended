# BSC candidates ranked 351–400

The [investigation report](evidence/ranks351-400-investigation.json) selects the
next 50 candidates from the original immutable RPC stream for blocks
122288006–122289029. They account for **1,685 reference observations** across
the complete interval. The exploratory survey uses **269 sampled Extended
blocks** and records **1,654 successful RPC value comparisons**, with no RPC
errors or historical value mismatches. It preserves mapper errors and missing
rows; matching candidate values are not equivalent to mapper qualification.

Forty-four candidates have a unique matching mapping hypothesis. The
[getter controls](evidence/ranks351-400-getters.json) inspect those 44 and find
one nonzero-word transformation: XVS's `uint96` getter. Its separately verified
[width correction and holder audit](xvs-uint96.md) add one qualified profile.
That follow-up left 49 candidates outside its combined configuration. The
subsequent [MUSD/GAIX source-led qualification](direct-discovery-gaps.md) adds
two profiles, leaving 47. The later [direct and proxy qualification](ranks400-coverage.md)
adds 27 more, leaving **20** from this group unqualified and **25** among the
first 400 overall.

Eleven historical runtime hashes matched an already reviewed family. Their
later qualification independently checks each candidate's code, pointers,
getter and storage dependencies, followed by complete packaged RPC and holder
replay. Matching a shell or a sampled value alone does not promote a profile.

The six candidates below the direct-mapping discovery threshold are AR (351), ARZ (354),
ARS (364), 10SET (377), MUSD (386) and GAIX (394). That status is a discovery
gap, not a claimed zero balance or a proven computed getter. MUSD and GAIX have
source-bound direct getters; each matching hypothesis had only one nonzero
holder. Their later qualification uses independent source/getter and full
interval checks without relaxing discovery thresholds. 10SET's verified source uses reflection accounting.
Baby Doge (372) also has a reflection getter; a sample on its excluded-account
branch is not proof of a direct mapping for all holders. The subsequent
[reflection diagnostic](reflection-holder-model.md) confirms that distinction
and passive holder changes, without promoting either token.

All source/runtime and diagnostic evidence remains separate from production
qualification. Cold unknowns, emitted rows, initialized retained holders and
global enumeration retain their distinct scopes. Ethereum, Base, HyperEVM and
Arc still require their own qualification after the BSC work.
