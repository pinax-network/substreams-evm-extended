# Network qualification sequence

After the BSC candidate review, repeat the same qualification on **Ethereum,
Base, HyperEVM and Arc**, in that order. These networks are requested work;
they are not yet qualified by the BSC evidence.

[Preparatory RPC probes](evidence/network-rpc-prerequisites.json) now pass on all
four requested networks: live chain identity matches the configured registry,
the finalized head is available with a matching canonical parent, and canonical
block-hash code/storage/call requests succeed. These probes use the empty
address in a recent finalized block. They do not establish historical ERC-20
correctness, Extended-block/preimage availability or token/holder coverage.

The production interface stays one RPC-free `map_events` with shared
`evm.balances.v1.Events`, explicit verified layouts and default parameters `[]`.
All executable validation tooling and regressions stay in Rust.

For each network:

1. Verify the RPC chain identity, finalized-range support, canonical historical
   balance/storage reads, and availability of complete Extended blocks with
   storage writes and Keccak preimages. Record unsupported provider capabilities.
2. Capture the RPC reference stream and rank its active contracts. Keep the
   immutable capture, range, block hashes and ranking separate from other chains.
3. Qualify each token's getter and dependencies against its historical runtime.
   A shared address, symbol or implementation family is not a cross-chain proof.
4. Audit the actual packaged WASM against historical RPC, then replay retained
   holder state across consecutive blocks. Count initialized parity, cold-start
   unknowns, unchanged holders and any mismatches separately.
5. Add captured Rust regressions for new storage/getter behavior, and repeat the
   affected network's audits after each correction. Preserve incomplete runs.

Before those runs, replace the Rust tools' BSC-specific chain-ID and source
checks with an explicit network selection shared by ranking, inspection,
capture, audit and holder replay. Preserve wrong-chain rejection, canonical
block binding and finality checks. A provider that lacks a required feature
must not silently receive weaker validation.

The BSC campaign now includes **348 qualified profiles**. The latest
[source-led follow-up](direct-discovery-gaps.md) resolves MUSD and GAIX's
insufficient discovery samples without changing the two-holder threshold.
It adds 35 emitted RPC checks, 64 initialized observations and 18 final holder
balances. The combined package output matches every field for 108,561
previously RPC-verified emitted balances.

The earlier
[XVS follow-up](xvs-uint96.md) adds an explicitly reviewed `uint96` balance
getter, 19 emitted RPC checks, 36 initialized observations and 21 final holder
balances. The rebuilt package preserves every protobuf field for 108,526
previously RPC-verified emitted balances. The
[ranks 351–400 investigation](ranks351-400-investigation.md) now leaves 47 candidates
outside qualification, including reflection getters that cannot be promoted
from a sample on one account's direct-mapping branch.

The prior [13-token follow-up](pending350-coverage.md) adds reviewed direct mappings,
dividend bookkeeping, pinned proxy implementations and a first deployment.
All 295 new emitted balances, 517 initialized observations and 174 final
balances match RPC. Only 钻石 remains excluded from ranks 301–350; its getter
adds an external contribution even though sampled historical contributions
were zero. LBP, TITAN, ORD and YBC remain excluded from the earlier ranks.

The earlier 296-profile qualification comprised the original top 100 plus
49 from ranks 101–150, all 50 from ranks 151–200, 47 from ranks 201–250 and all 50
from ranks 251–300. That [earlier follow-up](pending300-coverage.md)
left LBP (143), TITAN (203), ORD (209) and YBC (238) outside the qualified
fixture; they remain excluded. hLBP has a captured mint in a separate older
interval. The latest combined capture preserves all 348 profiles' audited
output, with 347 emitting in the original 1,024-block interval. Captured DIA append and ETZ
swap-and-pop transactions now pass packaged RPC and initialized-holder checks,
in addition to the earlier captured shareholder tail pop. This is a bounded campaign. Completing it
does not establish support for every BSC token or complete global holder
enumeration. Broader EVM coverage will similarly be reported per network,
qualified runtime and tested interval, with checkpoints or full-history replay
required for holders whose prior balances cannot be derived from the window.

The remaining [LBP reward-state diagnostic](lbp-reward-model.md) now matches
594 sampled RPC observations and 34 simulated-state cases. It does not add
production LBP support: durable holder and reward state still requires a design
decision. The other networks remain at preliminary RPC prerequisite probes.

The [BabyDoge/10SET host model](reflection-holder-model.md) matches 329
independent historical getters and 48 read-only controls, including expected
reverts. Its raw-storage replay verifies passive 10SET holder changes that a
direct-balance update stream would miss. Both tokens remain outside production
qualification until dependency initialization, affected-holder output and
restart/rewind handling are established.

The [TITAN/ORD follow-up](external-getter-contexts.md) checks 96 additional ORD
candidate addresses and independently validates account attribution through
external proxies and nested callbacks. Both tokens remain unqualified; observed
zero rewards do not establish general raw-storage parity.

[YBC's compact trace](ybc-reward-trace.md) now exposes its 240-hour reward path
and verifies 986 distinct canonical storage words. Its subsequent
[host-only arithmetic model](ybc-reward-model.md) matches 24 independently
initialized snapshots and 30 read-only controls, explaining all six known
raw-word mismatches. Production state and affected-holder output remain
unqualified. The [next 50 BSC candidates](ranks301-350-investigation.md) originally
had 2,106 successful exploratory RPC checks and no value mismatches. The later
36-token and 13-token qualifications add the required mapper and holder evidence
for 49 of those candidates. 钻石 remains excluded; its boundary matches alone
cannot establish a plain mapping getter. Subsequent
[coupled storage controls](xvs-uint96.md#other-bsc-findings) activate that
contribution and expose account-level capacity, accrual and rounding behavior;
its full retained-state computation remains unqualified.

[hLBP's quiet-holder audit](hlbp-quiet-holder-coverage.md) confirms 88 initialized
observations and four final balances. Its new mint audit checks one emitted
balance, four observations and four final holders in a distinct older 64-block
interval. The two intervals remain separately measured. Empty output alone
cannot establish a holder's balance.
