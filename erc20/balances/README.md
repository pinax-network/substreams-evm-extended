# erc20/balances

A single RPC-free `map_events` reads Firehose Extended blocks and emits
**`evm.balances.v1.Events`**, using the exact shared protobuf and Rust types from
[`erc20/balances` in the original repository](https://github.com/pinax-network/substreams-evm/tree/9f723e4b28a3abad755384ff1329950ea1287938/erc20/balances)
and [`proto/v1/balances.proto`](../../proto/v1/balances.proto).
There are no intermediate map modules, imported map dependencies, custom protobufs
or generated bindings in this package. Only `map_events` creates an output cache.

This module requires Firehose Extended blocks. It lives in
`substreams-evm-extended` so Extended-only processing stays separate from the
original repository. The [native Substreams ClickHouse sink](clickhouse/README.md)
consumes these Events directly. No `db_out` module or custom database sink is
part of this workspace. [Migration provenance](../../docs/migration.md) distinguishes
the preserved historical package from the package built in this repository.

## Configurable verified layouts

No token address, balance slot or runtime is built into the mapper. Supply a JSON
array in the `map_events` parameter. The default is `[]`, which emits no balances.
Each entry describes a **previously qualified balance mapping**, optionally
with a reviewed zero-word fallback, address-derived balance, immutable empty
mapping, or pinned proxy:

| Field | Format | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `contract` | 20-byte `0x` hex | Token contract |
| `balance_slot` | 32-byte `0x` hex | Mapping base for reviewed unsigned balances |
| `code_hash` | 32-byte `0x` hex | Qualified runtime Keccak-256, checked by the Rust audit tools |
| `balance_bits` | Optional integer, 8–256 in whole bytes | Explicitly reviewed unsigned getter width at byte offset zero; omission retains all 256 bits. Cannot combine with other balance formulas or an immutable-empty mapping |
| `deployment` | Optional object | `block` and 32-byte `block_hash` pin first CREATE for a direct mapping or minimal proxy, without a zero-word fallback |
| `other_slots` | Optional array of 32-byte `0x` hex | Explicitly qualified non-balance scalar slots |
| `other_mapping_slots` | Optional array of 32-byte `0x` hex | Explicitly qualified non-balance mapping bases, including nested mappings |
| `other_mapping_words` | Optional object mapping 32-byte `0x` bases to counts 1–32 | Reviewed non-balance mappings with multiword values, such as governance checkpoint structs |
| `other_mapping_paths` | Optional array of `{root,key_types,offset,words}` | Reviewed non-balance paths with exact nesting depth and key types; offsets apply only to terminal fields. See [typed paths](docs/typed-mapping-paths.md) |
| `enumerable_address_sets` | Optional array of `{root,key_types,semantics}` | Explicit source-bound role-member sets with complete ordered array/index witnesses. Currently one `bytes32` key and `oz_3_4_2` semantics; see [prerequisites and limits](docs/enumerable-role-sets.md) |
| `voting_checkpoints` | Optional object | Reviewed OpenZeppelin `Trace208` arrays: `clock` is `block_number` or `timestamp`; `slots` lists direct array roots and `mapping_slots` lists `mapping(address => Trace208)` bases, all 32-byte hex |
| `address_lists` | Optional array of 32-byte `0x` hex roots | Reviewed `address[]` bookkeeping, with exact persisted witnesses for appends, tail pops and swap-and-pop removals |
| `zero_balance` | Optional object | `value` (32-byte `0x` hex uint256) replaces a zero mapping word; `storage_slot` (32 bytes) identifies its scalar dependency, omitted only for a runtime constant. Optional `excluded_addresses` lists verified runtime-constant holders (20-byte hex) whose zero words remain zero |
| `balance_divisor` | Optional object | Positive `value` and required `storage_slot` (both 32-byte `0x` hex). A reviewed getter returns `floor(raw / value)`; every persisted change to the divisor stops processing and invalidates retained holder balances |
| `proxy` | Optional object | `implementation_slot` (32 bytes), `implementation` (20 bytes), and implementation `code_hash` (32 bytes), all `0x` hex |
| `beacon_proxy` | Optional object, mutually exclusive with `proxy` | `beacon_slot`, `beacon`, `beacon_code_hash`, `implementation_slot`, `implementation`, `implementation_code_hash`; optional `proxy` pins one forwarding layer and `proxy_admin` pins its reviewed admin `{slot,address}`. Addresses are 20 bytes, slots/hashes 32 bytes |
| `minimal_proxy` | Optional object, mutually exclusive with other proxy kinds | `implementation` (20 bytes) and its `code_hash` (32 bytes); the token runtime hash must bind the exact standard 45-byte ERC-1167 forwarder |
| `address_hash_balance` | Optional object | Full 32-byte `modulus`, `offset`, `multiplier` constants and `stored_addresses` entries with a 32-byte `slot` and 20-byte `address`; all `0x` hex |
| `immutable_zero_mapping` | Optional boolean, default `false` | Caller-proven empty balance mapping that the pinned direct runtime cannot write; requires `deployment` and cannot combine with proxies or other balance rules |

The caller must establish that the configured projection equals `balanceOf` for the
pinned runtime. Matching a few samples or finding a mapping-shaped write alone
is insufficient. The mapper cannot infer preexisting code identity from a block
without code changes: independently qualify the starting runtime before using
it outside the audit tools. Persisted code changes to configured contracts
fail, including changes back to the expected runtime, except a qualified first
CREATE described below. For a configured proxy,
the tools also check the implementation storage word and implementation runtime
at both boundaries. The map rejects **every persisted implementation-slot write**
(including an upgrade and upgrade back) and all implementation code changes.
The implementation slot cannot appear in an ignore list. A proxy runtime hash
alone is insufficient; the implementation's balance semantics must also be reviewed.
For a reviewed beacon proxy, `beacon_slot` belongs to the token and
`implementation_slot` belongs to the separate beacon contract. The tools bind
both pointers, both dependency runtimes, and the beacon's `implementation()`
return value. The mapper rejects changes to either pointer or dependency code,
including a beacon upgrade with no token writes and an upgrade followed by a
restore. The caller must review that the beacon getter reads this scalar directly
or through the single explicitly pinned forwarding layer described below.
Arbitrary computed beacon resolvers remain unsupported. Diamond proxies,
rebasing balances and computed balances outside the explicit rule below remain
unsupported.

`other_mapping_paths` can express a nested role-membership boolean separately
from its outer admin field. Each path requires a complete verified Keccak chain
and canonical key padding. It does not permit extra nesting or apply a field's
offset to intermediate mappings. Existing `other_mapping_slots` and
`other_mapping_words` retain their broader legacy semantics; migrate a profile
only after reviewing its complete source/runtime and validating the narrower
configuration. The new rule is currently checked offline; the committed SPKGs
and historical qualification reports predate it. See the
[supported shapes and validation limits](docs/typed-mapping-paths.md).

`enumerable_address_sets` separately validates complete correlated role-member
array/index operations, with event-level permissions and no persistent set
cache. This is opt-in support for a reviewed runtime/write order, not automatic
OpenZeppelin or DSG qualification. The initial set invariants must be verified
by the caller. [The rule's documentation](docs/enumerable-role-sets.md) describes
unchanged-write handling and the outstanding producer/package checks.

For `minimal_proxy`, the implementation address is embedded in the exact
[ERC-1167 runtime](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1167), rather than a storage
pointer. Configuration binds the runtime hash to that forwarder and target. The
audit checks the implementation code, and ingestion rejects implementation code
changes even without token writes. Other clone bytecode variants require separate
qualification; an immutable forwarding address does not make its target code or
balance semantics automatically safe.

With `deployment`, the tools verify empty code and nonce zero immediately before
the pinned block, and the expected runtime at deployment and audit boundaries.
The mapper requires exactly one persisted code creation in a successful CREATE,
checks its runtime bytes and execution ordinals, and rejects earlier storage/code
activity, nonzero initial storage, and later code changes. Constructor writes
before the code-change ordinal are included. Deployment support currently applies
only to direct mappings and standard minimal proxies; storage-pointer proxy and
fallback initialization remain unsupported.
The native holder replay initializes the observed holder set to zero **at the
validated CREATE**, then applies that block's writes. It does not call `balanceOf`
before deployment or treat an unavailable response as zero. This is a bounded
test baseline, not a complete global holder enumeration.

When a beacon's `implementation()` getter itself uses a proxy, configure
`beacon_proxy.proxy` with that forwarding layer's `implementation_slot`,
`implementation` and `code_hash` (the same hex formats as `proxy`). The slot
lives at the beacon address. Qualification pins it and its runtime at both
boundaries. Every persisted change to either beacon pointer, or to the delegate
runtime, stops processing even if no token holder changes and even if restored
in the same block. One reviewed forwarding layer is supported; additional
getter dependencies still need explicit qualification. See the
[BSC proxy follow-up](docs/ranked-proxy-coverage.md).

For a transparent proxy used as the beacon, configure `beacon_proxy.proxy_admin`
with its reviewed admin slot and address. The slot belongs to beacon storage.
Making the token its beacon's admin changes the `implementation()` dispatch and
can make `balanceOf` revert despite unchanged balance words. Qualification pins
the admin at both boundaries; the mapper rejects any persisted change, including
change-and-restore and blocks without holder writes. The admin slot must differ
from both beacon implementation pointers, and the admin must differ from the
token. This rule requires the optional beacon `proxy` layer; other caller-based
resolver behavior still requires separate review.

With `balance_bits`, the public amount uses only the lower configured bits.
Raw 256-bit words remain intact through continuity checks, so equal public
balances cannot conceal inconsistent storage history. This supports reviewed
`uintN` getters such as XVS's `uint96`; it does not infer widths, signed values
or arbitrary struct offsets from samples. Existing layouts retain full-word
behavior when the field is absent. See the [XVS qualification](docs/xvs-uint96.md).

With `balance_divisor`, raw storage words remain intact through continuity checks,
then unsigned floor division produces the public amount. Checkpoint values use
the same projection. The qualification runner pins the divisor at both interval
boundaries; the mapper rejects any persisted change, including change-and-restore
and blocks without holder writes. Reverted changes and unchanged words are safe.
This rule cannot combine with another balance formula or a deployment baseline.
It covers an explicitly verified interval with a stable conversion value, not
rebasing across rate changes: requalify and rebuild retained holder balances
before resuming after a change. See the [BSC ranks 101–150 review](docs/ranks101-150-coverage.md).

With `zero_balance`, nonzero mapping words pass through unchanged. Zero words
emit the explicitly pinned fallback, except for caller-qualified
`excluded_addresses`, which retain zero. Exclusions apply only to zero words;
nonzero balances for those holders still pass through. No burn-address exception
is hardcoded. Only runtime-constant exceptions are supported, not mutable holder
selectors. Raw words still drive continuity checks;
projection happens only at output. For a storage-dependent fallback, the tools
verify its value at both boundaries, and the mapper rejects **every persisted
dependency-slot write**, including change-and-restore and holder-silent changes.
The dependency cannot be ignored. Such changes need requalification and a rebuild
of affected holder state; they are not implemented as silent global updates.

`voting_checkpoints` supports the reviewed packed `uint48` clock / `uint208`
vote histories separately from balances. Array roots must not overlap other
configured fields. Mapping roots require verified address/slot Keccak preimages.
Length writes must preserve continuity and append at most one entry per clock;
an append must be followed by its exact final element, initially empty. Element
writes retain the current clock and their own old/new continuity.

Timestamp histories can update their last entry across blocks in the same
second without writing the length. Such updates require the old and new packed
clock to equal the block timestamp and may touch only one element per array.
The index cannot exceed the clock: the qualified insertion rule permits only
one entry for each distinct nonnegative clock value. This bound follows from
the reviewed contract semantics; it is not a configurable arbitrary ignore
range. Block-number histories always require the append witness in the current
block. Arbitrary arrays, different packed formats and custom clocks remain
unsupported by this rule, and unknown writes still fail.

`address_lists` supports separately qualified `address[]` bookkeeping that is
independent of the balance getter. Each length change must add or remove exactly
one entry. An append's length increment must precede its new element write at
`keccak256(root) + old_length`, modulo `2^256`, before the next length change.
That element must start empty and contain a canonical 20-byte address.

A removal must clear the old final element before decrementing the length.
Swap-and-pop may first copy that exact old tail address into one earlier element,
within the witnessed old length. Every accepted element write needs its own
ordinal witness; repeated writes to a slot must preserve old/new continuity.
This permits append/pop/reappend sequences without accepting extra overwrites.
Element indices must fit `u64`; the final valid length can equal `2^64`.
No guessed roots or unrestricted element ranges are accepted.
The [Solidity storage rules](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/internals/layout_in_storage.html#mappings-and-dynamic-arrays)
place each address in a separate word. Compiler-embedded array roots do not
require a captured Keccak preimage because the exact root is caller-qualified.

A null-address append or removal retains its zero-to-zero element write as a
validation witness. It does not enable ordinary balance no-op output.
Reverted/failed writes cannot authorize persisted list changes. Missing or
reused witnesses, arbitrary overwrites, unmatched clears, malformed values and
roots overlapping other configured fields fail.
The reviewed list is bookkeeping, not a source of inferred holder balances.

With `address_hash_balance`, ordinary holders return
`(uint256(keccak256(packed_20_byte_address)) % modulus + offset) * multiplier`.
The modulus must be nonzero and the full expression must fit uint256. Holders
selected by the low 160 bits of the configured scalar slots instead read
`balance_slot`. The tools qualify these selectors at both boundaries; the map
rejects changes to either selector, including change-and-restore. Reviewed
packed flags above those address bits can change. This rule cannot be combined
with a zero-word fallback or deployment initialization.

Computed holders can emit without a storage write. Transfer, Approval and the
reference's non-indexed OwnershipTransferred event supply their participants,
transaction sender and token address, using the same ABI decoders and persisted
log selection as the reference. Unreviewed or malformed events on these tokens
fail. Special stored holders still require a write or verified prior state;
the map never guesses their balance. The native holder replay computes ordinary
holders' initial values independently and reports them separately from measured
RPC checkpoint reads. This narrow rule requires a runtime/getter review and
does not infer balance semantics from event amounts.

With `immutable_zero_mapping`, the caller must prove that the first CREATE leaves
the balance mapping empty and the complete pinned direct runtime cannot write it.
The getter must read that mapping directly. An empty capture or sampled zero RPC
responses are insufficient. The qualified invariant supplies zero for observed
Transfer/Approval/OwnershipTransferred participants, senders and token contracts,
using the same reference ABI decoders and null-address exclusion. Unknown or
malformed events still fail. This preserves the reference's rows for reviewed
log-only contracts without inferring values from the logged amounts.

The mapper validates the pinned first CREATE when processing its block, rejects
events before deployment/CREATE, and rejects every persisted balance-mapping
write, including zero-to-zero and other no-op records. Code changes and unknown
storage writes also fail. Reverted execution cannot trigger output or these
persisted-write checks. Ordinary layouts keep their existing no-op filtering.
The native replay records this zero baseline separately from RPC checkpoints and
address formulas, and never initializes it before the qualified deployment.
Raw-word diagnostics still expose a nonzero word instead of masking it as zero.

Verified Keccak preimages identify holder keys. Transaction/call/log addresses
are fallback candidates, accepted only when their mapping hash matches exactly.
Persisted writes are ordered by execution ordinal; reverted execution cannot
emit balances. Direct layouts preserve zero and full uint256 values; fallback
layouts apply their explicit zero rule. Null holder addresses are excluded, as in
the RPC reference. Unknown
writes for a configured token cause an error unless they belong to an explicitly
configured other slot/mapping. Unconfigured contracts emit no rows.

Identical protobuf format does not mean complete ERC-20 coverage: unchanged
stored-balance participants and holders with no observed write remain unknown.
Explicit address-derived and immutable-zero layouts cover their qualified
observed holders without writes, but do not enumerate every possible address. The reference
also queries approval participants, senders, token contracts and special events.
Missing data never becomes zero. A full holder dataset still needs a verified
bootstrap and additional qualified token semantics.

## Build and Rust tests

```sh
make -C erc20/balances test
make -C erc20/balances pack
```

Output: `spkg/erc20-balances-v0.1.0.spkg`. No Buf generation is needed here;
the public schema is already maintained by the shared `proto` crate.

The first build of this renamed package is committed (SPKG `532b571f…`, WASM
`005a2d3d…`, module hash `4a64d86d…`) and was run on 1,024 live BSC blocks on
2026-09-23: see [current package on live BSC](docs/live-package-bsc-2026-09-23.md).
A later rebuild is a new artifact and does not inherit those checks. The build,
audit and native sink defaults all use this path and never substitute an older
artifact. The storage-named SPKGs remain historical evidence, while
`spkg/erc20-balances-v0.3.4.spkg` is the immutable RPC reference. See
[rename provenance](../../docs/migration.md#module-rename).

Tests call extraction functions directly in Rust. They cover two arbitrary token
addresses with different mapping bases (including a full-width 256-bit base),
zero/max values, allowances, malformed configuration, code changes, reverted and
failed transactions, real captured blocks, RPC failures and schema compatibility.
Captured WBNB `deposit()`/`withdraw()` transactions without any `Transfer`
event, including reverted frames and a Permit2-mediated transfer, are the
[non-Transfer mutation corpus](docs/non-transfer-mutations.md).
The native tools' HTTP/SQLite dependencies do not enter the mapper's WASM.

## Compare and audit

The regression layout file below is an **explicit test input**, containing the
previously qualified BSC WBNB layout. It is not a default or built-in token list.
Replace it with your qualified layouts. Current live qualification uses BSC.

```sh
cargo run --locked -p erc20-balances-tools -- audit-rpc \
  --layouts erc20/balances/tests/fixtures/verified-layouts.json \
  --start 122260950 --blocks 64 \
  --output erc20/balances/out/single-map-audit

cargo run --locked -p erc20-balances-tools -- compare \
  --layouts erc20/balances/tests/fixtures/verified-layouts.json \
  --start 122260950 --blocks 64 \
  --output erc20/balances/out/single-map-comparison
```

Both commands capture only `map_events`. The comparison reference is
`erc20-balances-v0.3.4.spkg`. Runtime identity is verified at both range boundaries
for every configured token. `audit-rpc` checks **every emitted end-of-block
balance** with EIP-1898 `blockHash` / `requireCanonical: true`. The shared Events
schema has no old values or source hash; old/new extraction ordering is tested
natively, while live audit binds finalized capture heights to RPC headers and
rechecks their continuity/stability. It trusts provider finality, not independent
consensus proofs.

The CLI omits empty Events from JSONL, and emitted rows do not carry block IDs.
The Rust capture tool requires the original CLI delivery count to cover the
whole requested range, then captures block clocks for the same package and
parameters. Every clock must be consecutive and match a canonical RPC header,
including when every block emits. Only then is an absent Events message recorded
as an empty list. Original output, clocks and their digests are retained.
Truncated delivery, gaps, duplicate clocks, forks and wrong hashes still fail;
absent holder balances are never filled with zero.

All observed rows, value differences and coverage gaps are retained in SQLite;
reference-only holders never seed candidate state. Raw captures, RPC checks and
JSON reports remain in each new output directory, including partial failures.
Comparison exits zero only for bounded value and row-coverage parity. RPC audit
exits zero only when all emitted values pass and at least one was checked.

Use `--endpoint` for the Substreams endpoint. RPC uses `RPC_URL` (default
`https://bsc.rpc.pinax.network`) with optional `RPC_API_KEY` or
`SUBSTREAMS_API_KEY`. The Substreams CLI uses its normal authentication.
Credentials remain in environment variables, not report fields.

## Native layout discovery

Discovery operates directly on captured `sf.ethereum.type.v2.Block` protobuf
files in the Rust tool. It is excluded from WASM, has no map handler and creates
no Substreams cache:

```sh
cargo run --locked -p erc20-balances-tools -- probe-erc20 \
  --block-file erc20/balances/tests/fixtures/bsc-122260950.pb \
  --output erc20/balances/out/native-discovery
```

Repeat `--block-file` for consecutive blocks. These must be full Extended block
fixtures, not JSON-RPC blocks. Hypotheses are checked with historical `balanceOf`
and remain diagnostics; no layout is automatically promoted into parameters.
See [qualification](docs/qualification.md) and [ERC-20 expansion](docs/erc20-expansion.md).

## Test the busiest tokens from the RPC stream

The Rust tools can select tokens from actual `erc20/balances` output and test
their storage on earlier/later active block samples. They create no additional
Substreams modules or caches. See the [first top-ten results](docs/top-token-parity.md).

```sh
cargo run --locked -p erc20-balances-tools -- rank-tokens \
  --blocks 512 --top 10 --output erc20/balances/out/ranking

cargo run --locked -p erc20-balances-tools -- capture-blocks \
  --ranking erc20/balances/out/ranking/report.json \
  --samples-per-token 8 --output erc20/balances/out/active-blocks

cargo run --locked -p erc20-balances-tools -- test-ranked \
  --ranking erc20/balances/out/ranking/report.json \
  --block-dir erc20/balances/out/active-blocks \
  --layouts erc20/balances/tests/fixtures/verified-layouts.json \
  --output erc20/balances/out/ranked-parity
```

`rank-tokens` defaults to a window just before the finalized BSC head; `--start`
makes it reproducible. Ranking counts emitted balance rows, not market cap or
transfer count. `capture-blocks` uses the `firecore` CLI with gzip and canonical
block IDs; both it and `substreams` must be on PATH. Configure their endpoints
with `--endpoint`; RPC credentials follow the environment variables above.

The test selects a mapping hypothesis from the earlier half of each token's
sampled active blocks, then freezes it for the later half. It checks every
observed candidate value before and after the block with hash-pinned `balanceOf`.
Mismatches also trigger a hash-pinned `eth_getStorageAt` check. The actual native
mapper is replayed with caller-supplied reviewed layouts when available; other
tokens use **unqualified diagnostic inputs with empty ignore lists**. Unknown
writes remain mapper errors, never automatically become ignored storage.

Each report separates hypothesis values from strict mapper output and missing
reference rows. No state is carried across missing sampled blocks, no RPC row
seeds the mapper, and no hypothesis is promoted into configuration. A completed
investigation with gaps or mismatches exits nonzero; `bounded_parity` alone exits
zero and still does not establish universal token semantics. Preserve the entire
output directory: JSONL observations and checks are referenced by their SHA-256
digests in the report. Repeat `--block-dir` to add more captured samples.

## Reviewed candidates and holder state

The latest [five-profile follow-up and role corrections](docs/refined450-coverage.md)
bring the explicit test configuration to 431 profiles among the first 450
RPC-stream candidates in `tests/fixtures/bsc-refined450-layouts.json`.
USDe, CONCILIUM, GIGGLE, LABUBU and ARKIE match 85 emitted RPC balances,
141 initialized observations and all 59 final holder balances. Regressions
cover bridge rate records, fixed arrays, packed transfer metadata and
LABUBU's reentrancy guard. [MUSD and OLY](docs/role-width-coverage.md) replace
two existing role layouts with narrower rules and separately revalidate
204 emitted balances and 88 final holders, without counting them twice.
The preceding [SLX, PIN, NXT and short-proxy follow-up](docs/access450-coverage.md)
retains its permit, null-address burn and proxy evidence. The preceding
[nine-profile source follow-up](docs/source450-coverage.md) retains its
complete historical getter/runtime and metadata evidence.
The preceding [nineteen-profile follow-up](docs/ranks450-coverage.md) retains
its direct and proxy evidence.
[APM's zero-word fallback](docs/apm450-coverage.md) corrects two original value
mismatches; direct and proxy runtime matches retain independently checked
metadata and dispatch guards. The unchanged package matches every protobuf
event field for 110,139 previously
RPC-verified balances across the combined configuration. This reuses preserved
RPC evidence and does not establish a new full-431 holder checkpoint.
The [broader role-shape audit](docs/role-shape-audit.md) records remaining
synthetic guard boundaries in 33 boolean-role and eight enumerable-role
profiles. Some have reachable admin writers and need exact storage-path
recognition; removing every multiword rule would reject legitimate writes.
These findings do not allege historical balance mismatches or establish
that fabricated writes are reachable.

The opt-in [enumerable role-set rule](docs/enumerable-role-sets.md) provides
source-level validation for the reviewed DSG operation shape. The published
431-profile cohort is unchanged; producer visibility, package parity and
individual role-profile qualification remain separate follow-up gates.
The preceding [ten-profile follow-up](docs/tail400-coverage.md) retains its
packed swap/lock metadata and minimal-proxy evidence.
The preceding [three Cake-LP profiles](docs/lp400-coverage.md) retain their
complete getter, fixed-field, allowance and nonce evidence.
The [AR, ARZ and ARS follow-up](docs/sparse400-coverage.md) retains its separate
bytecode and sparse-discovery evidence. BabyDoge and 10SET from
the [ranks 351–400 investigation](docs/ranks351-400-investigation.md) remain unqualified,
alongside LBP, TITAN, ORD, YBC and 钻石 from earlier ranks. The
[ranks 401–450 diagnosis](docs/next450-mismatch-diagnosis.md) separately explains
seven original value mismatches in APM and OG. APM is now qualified separately;
the [OG host model](docs/og450-host-model.md) remains outside production support.
The [Dood and DeepTokenOFT follow-up](docs/proxy400-coverage.md) and previous
[27-profile cohort](docs/ranks400-coverage.md) retain their separate source,
proxy-family and holder evidence. The earlier
[MUSD/GAIX follow-up](docs/direct-discovery-gaps.md) retains its separate evidence.
The [reflection host model](docs/reflection-holder-model.md) matches 329
historical getter checks for BabyDoge and 10SET and confirms passive 10SET
holder changes, but does not add production reflection support. The
[XVS width follow-up](docs/xvs-uint96.md) retains its `uint96` getter evidence.
The prior [13-token cohort](docs/pending350-coverage.md) retains its separate
direct-mapping, dividend-bookkeeping, proxy and deployment evidence. These
figures do not claim global holders or all-token support. The original
[survey](docs/ranks301-350-investigation.md) and earlier
[36-token qualification](docs/ranks301-350-coverage.md) retain their separate scopes.

The earlier [top-300 follow-up](docs/pending300-coverage.md) retains the previous
296-profile scope and separate older DIA append and ETZ swap-and-pop captures.
Earlier reports below keep their original cohort scopes.

`tests/fixtures/bsc-reviewed-layouts.json` explicitly configures BSC USDT, BTCB,
USDC (pinned implementation), and the existing WBNB control. The file is not a
default. See [expanded qualification and holder coverage](docs/holder-coverage.md)
for source/runtime evidence, the zero-word mismatch explanation and live checks.

The [next BNB qualification](docs/next-bnb-candidates.md) adds ETH, BUSD, CAKE and
USD1 in `tests/fixtures/bsc-expanded-layouts.json`. It includes multiword governance
storage, an ABI decoding compatibility fix, and explicit diagnosis of calls before
contract deployment. The new fixture is also caller-supplied, never a default.

The [fallback and vUSDT follow-up](docs/fallback-balances.md) expands the explicit
test configuration to 14 tokens in `tests/fixtures/bsc-fallback-layouts.json`.
It fixes all seven recorded fallback-value mismatches and qualifies vUSDT's
custom proxy implementation using Venus's published deployment artifact.

The [beacon and zero-path follow-up](docs/beacon-and-zero-paths.md) adds KII,
BNC4, WCOL and three further fallback profiles to the explicit
`tests/fixtures/bsc-beacon-layouts.json` test input. `inspect-ranked` probes zero,
1, 123 and uint256 max on candidate mappings. This catches fallback paths absent
from ordinary transfer samples; passing these controls never automatically
qualifies a layout.

The [deployment follow-up](docs/deployment-holder-coverage.md) qualifies a direct
token's first mint. The [clone follow-up](docs/clone-holder-coverage.md) adds a
source-verified minimal-proxy implementation and replays both deployments with
`tests/fixtures/bsc-clone-layouts.json` (22 explicit test layouts). Three more
individually checked tokens with that same implementation are included in
`tests/fixtures/bsc-clone-family-layouts.json` (25 layouts).

The [address-derived balance follow-up](docs/computed-holder-coverage.md) adds the
rank-7 token to `tests/fixtures/bsc-computed-family-layouts.json` (26 explicit
test layouts). Its 3,000 Transfer logs have no balance writes, so a pure storage
delta stream cannot discover their public balances. The qualified getter rule
covers ordinary participants while preserving the special stored-holder gap.

The [source-verified direct-token follow-up](docs/direct-source-holder-coverage.md)
adds 13 profiles in `tests/fixtures/bsc-direct-source-layouts.json` (39 explicit
test layouts): POWER, two FourERC20 tokens, AKE, ZEC, MMPRO, ASTER, a fee-bearing
ProToken, AIN, SKYAI, PIEVERSE, BULLA and ARK. Their getters read direct balance
mappings; transfer fees, permit nonces and minting roles are reviewed separately
from those mappings. Unknown non-balance writes still fail.

The [proxy-token follow-up](docs/securities-proxy-holder-coverage.md) adds two
SecuritiesToken beacon proxies and a StablecoinV2 transparent proxy in
`tests/fixtures/bsc-securities-proxy-layouts.json` (42 explicit test layouts).
Namespaced balances remain raw even when a scheduled UI multiplier changes.
Pause and freeze flags likewise do not transform the stablecoin's balance getter.
Proxy, beacon and implementation identities are checked separately.

The [top-50 follow-up](docs/top50-holder-coverage.md) adds the remaining eight
ranked contracts in `tests/fixtures/bsc-top50-layouts.json`. Their direct mapping
getters are qualified from historical bytecode, traces and controls; verified
Solidity source was unavailable. Three share an already reviewed runtime.
The fixture covers all 50 contracts in the original ranking, with per-token
holder-state results and explicit cold-start gaps.

The [ranks 51–100 follow-up](docs/next-candidate-holder-coverage.md) qualifies 26
more candidates, bringing `tests/fixtures/bsc-next-candidates-layouts.json` to 76
profiles. It also fixes holder-specific zero fallbacks found by explicit burn
address controls, including one previously sampled token. The retained reports
describe the exact earlier artifacts; historical fixture digests predate this
correction. That batch left 24 candidates unqualified.

The [next proxy and deployment batch](docs/next-proxy-holder-coverage.md) qualifies
eleven of those candidates, bringing `tests/fixtures/bsc-next-proxy-layouts.json`
to 87 profiles. It covers eight FlapTaxTokenV3 clones, a TokenV2 clone, GMToken and
BTRToken, including two new deployment baselines. Thirteen of the original top
100 candidates remain unqualified.

The [voting-token review](docs/voting-holder-coverage.md) adds SENTIS and STAR in
`tests/fixtures/bsc-voting-layouts.json`, bringing the configured test set to 89.
It includes older deployment/mint captures that exercise voting checkpoint
arrays, beyond ordinary transfers in the ranked window. Eleven of the original
top 100 candidates remain unqualified.

The [direct-bytecode follow-up](docs/direct-bytecode-holder-coverage.md) adds
eight source-unavailable contracts in `tests/fixtures/bsc-direct-bytecode-layouts.json`,
bringing the configured test set to 97. Qualification uses reviewed historical
getter bytecode, independent storage overrides and captured writes, including
SAC's burn counter and 79AU's block tracking and packed temporary flag. It does
not claim verified source. Three of the original top 100 candidates remain
unqualified in that batch.

The [final proxy review](docs/final-proxy-holder-coverage.md) adds 4Stock and CAP
in `tests/fixtures/bsc-final-proxy-layouts.json`, bringing the test set to 99.
4Stock's reward accounting is separate from its raw balance mapping; that
bounded fixture permits only its reviewed reward fields.
That batch left one log-only candidate outside its coverage claim.

The [immutable-zero follow-up](docs/immutable-zero-holder-coverage.md) closes that
candidate's gap in `tests/fixtures/bsc-top100-layouts.json`. Its captured CREATE
leaves the balance mapping empty, and the reviewed runtime's only storage write
updates allowances. The explicit rule produces all 298 independently checked
reference rows from its captured activity. This completes layout review of the
original top 100, subject to each profile's documented path and holder limits;
it does not establish support for every BSC token. See the
[network expansion sequence](docs/network-expansion.md) for Ethereum, Base,
HyperEVM and Arc qualification after BSC.

The [holder-registration follow-up](docs/holder-registration-coverage.md) extends
4Stock in `tests/fixtures/bsc-holder-registration-layouts.json` with its pinned
first deployment, initialization fields, membership flag and witnessed address
list. The original campaign fixtures and reports retain their original scope.
This extension accepts qualified list appends without using membership to infer
balances, and keeps the same one-map interface and empty production defaults.

```sh
cargo run --locked -p erc20-balances-tools -- inspect-ranked \
  --survey erc20/balances/out/ranked-parity/report.json \
  --output erc20/balances/out/zero-path-review
```

The original survey and checks must remain together, with their recorded digest.
The probe selects post-block holders and can revisit earlier unresolved RPC
responses using the current decoder. Contracts without a mapping candidate stay
explicitly untested. Use repeated `--contract` filters to narrow a sweep.

`recheck-rpc --checks <rpc-checks.jsonl> --output <new-directory>` diagnoses prior
unresolved checks without overwriting them. `test-ranked` accepts repeated
`--contract` filters for focused retests of selected ranked tokens and records the
selection in its report. Token RPC output follows the reference ABI decoder: a
complete leading uint256 word is required and trailing return bytes are accepted.

The `holder-coverage` Rust command compares a cold consumer with one initialized
from a **test-only historical RPC checkpoint**. It requires consecutive captured
blocks and a ranking that includes them:

```sh
cargo run --locked -p erc20-balances-tools -- holder-coverage \
  --ranking erc20/balances/out/ranking/report.json \
  --block-dir erc20/balances/out/consecutive-blocks \
  --layouts erc20/balances/tests/fixtures/bsc-reviewed-layouts.json \
  --output erc20/balances/out/holder-state-test
```

It records the setup RPC reads and checkpoint hash, then applies actual map
outputs without consulting RPC for balances during processing. Reference amounts
are only compared, never inserted into consumer state. The test checkpoint covers
only addresses queried in that bounded reference window; it is not a complete
global holder snapshot or a deployed sink. Full cold-start coverage still needs
a trusted checkpoint or complete history, plus a consumer that retains updates.

`inspect-balance --contract ... --address ... --balance-slot ... --block ...
--output ...` diagnoses a mapping at a canonical block using `debug_traceCall`
and read-only state overrides for zero, 1, 123 and uint256 max. Optional
`--source <Sourcify-v2-response.json>` verifies that the source record's runtime
matches the historical runtime before saving its layout/provenance. Overrides
simulate `eth_call`; no transaction is sent.

For large getters, `--compact-trace` omits per-step memory, storage snapshots
and return data while retaining stack and call-depth attribution. This option
also works with `inspect-ranked`; compact traces cannot recover mapping
preimages from memory. Successful word controls remain recorded if a later
control reverts. The [YBC diagnostic](docs/ybc-reward-trace.md) recovers a real
reward-bearing trace and preserves its expected maximal-word overflow.
The subsequent [YBC arithmetic model](docs/ybc-reward-model.md) explains all six
known raw-word mismatches, with 24 historical snapshots and 30 read-only control
cases retained as Rust fixtures. YBC remains outside production qualification.

For a project-published deployment artifact, use `--deployment-artifact <json>`
with `--artifact-url <immutable-source-url>` instead of `--source`. The tool binds
the artifact address and runtime to historical RPC and checks each literal
source's hash. `--zero-dependency-slot <32-byte-hex>` also probes the scalar
dependency with zero, 17 and uint256 max while controlling the holder word.
These controls are evidence for review, not automatic layout qualification.
